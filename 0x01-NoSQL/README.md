# NoSQL - MongoDB

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding NoSQL databases, particularly MongoDB. It covers various aspects such as the differences between SQL and NoSQL, document storage, querying, and using MongoDB with Python. By the end of the project, you should be able to explain the concepts of NoSQL databases and work with MongoDB efficiently.
